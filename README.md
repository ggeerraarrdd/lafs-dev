## Description

In the early aughts, I created a website for the _Landscape Architecture Film Series_, a student-led initiative which I co-founded and co-curated for the [Department of Landscape Architecture](https://landarch.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Now some odd years later, I needed a website to use as a learning vehicle for back-end technical skill-building. But not wanting to spend anytime to ideate and design a new one from scratch, I turned to my old website. Its look and feel has aged well, I think, and indeed looks remarkably contemporary. For instance, if the current version of MoMA's film series [website](https://www.moma.org/calendar/film/) is anything to go by, bold color blocking isn't a dated design choice. In other words, I could focus on the back-end and spend little or no time on the front-end.

Tossed into this development playground, it has so far borne out the following:

* [**_LAFS_**](https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/lafs)

  A GitHub repository serving as the digital coding archive of the website, transformed as a dynamic web application.

  What would otherwise exist as slowly disintegrating bits on a forgotten CD in a remote storage facility or as [fragmented snapshots](https://web.archive.org/web/20040827234527/http://www.rehearsal.uiuc.edu/projects/filmseries/) somewhere in the depths of the Internet Archive has been meticulously restored and recreated.

  No longer basic or staticâ€”but a dynamic web application with modern tooling such as Python, Flask, and SQLite. It even has a data model to speak of. It's interesting to note that the original website predated almost all of the technology used.

* [**_LAFSCMS_**](https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/lafs-dev)

  A companion Content Management System (CMS) for the web application (this repository; separate repo coming soon).

  Just like any real-world organization, student-run organizations such as a film series experience knowledge loss when their members graduate. Without a knowledge transfer process, this loss can lead to technical resources being underutilized or becoming inactive. While alternative resources and processes may exist, they either need to be created from scratch, requiring significant time and resources, or are imperfect substitutes. If existing resources work perfectly fine, why go through all that effort?

  LAFSCMS, then, was conceived as a solution to the problem of knowledge loss by providing a platform to manage content and users efficiently with a user-friendly web interface.

What else might be concocted out from a decades-old website? Stay tuned!
